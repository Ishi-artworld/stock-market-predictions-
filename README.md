# stock-market-predictions-
Introduction

The stock market is highly volatile, and predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to many influencing factors such as economic indicators, market sentiment, and global events.

This project uses Machine Learning models (such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM Neural Networks) to forecast stock prices based on historical data. It also visualizes stock price trends and compares predicted vs actual values.

# Features

#Predicts stock closing prices for chosen companies

# Visualizes historical stock data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)

# Compares different ML models (Regression, LSTM, etc.)

#Shows prediction accuracy with error metrics (RMSE, MAPE, etc.)

# Easy to extend for any stock ticker or custom dataset

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python 3

Libraries & Frameworks:

Pandas, NumPy – Data processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine Learning models

TensorFlow / Keras – Deep Learning (LSTM)

yfinance / Alpha Vantage API – Stock data collection

# Dataset

The dataset is collected from Yahoo Finance
 (via yfinance library) or Kaggle stock datasets.

Data includes columns like:

Date

Open Price

High Price

Low Price

Close Price

Adjusted Close

Volume

Example command to download data:

import yfinance as yf
data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2015-01-01", end="2023-12-31")
print(data.head())

# Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-prediction.git
cd stock-market-prediction


Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage

Run the main script:

python main.py --stock AAPL --days 30


Or open the Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step execution:

jupyter notebook stock_prediction.ipynb


Example workflow:

Fetch stock data

Preprocess dataset

Train ML model

Predict next 30 days of stock prices

Visualize predictions

#Results

The project provides actual vs predicted stock price plots.

Example graph:

Model Evaluation Metrics:

RMSE: XX

MAE: XX

Accuracy: XX%

#Future Improvements

Integrate real-time stock data using live APIs

Deploy project using Streamlit/Flask/Django for interactive dashboards

Add Sentiment Analysis (Twitter/News data) for better predictions

Experiment with advanced models (XGBoost, Prophet, Transformer models)
